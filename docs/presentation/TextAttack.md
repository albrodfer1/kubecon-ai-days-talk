# TextAttack

## Introduction

- Python framework for adversarial attacks, adversarial training and data augmentation in NLP
- Uses LLMs but just to generate responses to prompts
- Offers API and CLI
- Goals
  - Adversarial attacks
  - Data augmentation
  - Model training
    - train model against adversarial attacks
- Atacks
  - Goal functions: i.e: change the prediction score of a classification model or to change all of the words in a translation output
  - Constraints: Limits transformation
  - Transformations: transform text by inserting and deleting characters, words, or phrases
  - Search Methods: Explore the space of possble transformations within the defined constraints

## Notes

- Some attacks don't work
- Deprecated libraries
- Easy to use
- Not suitable for LLMs
